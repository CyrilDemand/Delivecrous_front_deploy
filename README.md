## Here are the ideas for improvements:

- [ ] Display a breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Better management of redirection to login (it doesn't work when navigating from one path to another via navigate, only when refreshing the page)
- [ ] Implement Redux for state management (the API calls are a bit chaotic)
- [ ] Ability to delete a repository? (it's going to be very tricky for little gain)
